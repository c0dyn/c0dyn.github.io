I am a first year computer science student at CSUF and I expect to graduate by 2027.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 3, Part-1
  This lab was fun because this was the first bit of real coding that we took on.
Figuring out the code was fun as it wasn't just printing text and was important code we use
in the rest of the labs.
The lab was important as it introduced us to functions and let us run our own 
numbers into the set formula of the function.

* Lab 6, Part-2
  This lab was fun and was my favorite one because we had to code the game blackjack. The code was different
than the previous with how it needed a lot more of everything. Booleans, functions, and if statements
were all used to create the game and it was fun seeing how we can already code simple card games.

* Lab 9, Part-2
  This lab was interesting because the code was a lot more condensed than the other codes. We had to use
  argv, and argc statements with sizes and lengths in order to print out schedules. I liked this code because
  rather than a game it has real-life purposes by syncing up schedules.
